This repository contains the main source code of PlasmaBot, the Discord bot.

As PlasmaBot rely on third-party services and other micro-services, not everything is in this repository


## Development cycle

## Versioning 

PlasmaBot's versioning works like semantic versioning, in the `major.minor.patch` format 

Bug fixes increments `patch` and new features/enhancements increments `minor`

Major rewrites of the back-end/interface increments `major`, each `major` increment comes with a reset of `minor` and `patch`
